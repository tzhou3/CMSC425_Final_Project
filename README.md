In Glacial, you are an eskimo trapped on a snowy island. Your objective? Explore the mountainous terrain and ruins, find and collect all 4 components of your sled, and make the big jump off the island to reunite with your friend. 

Controls:
WASD or arrow keys to move
Press I to toggle inventory and see how many pieces you still need to collect.
Press the spacebar to jump, and press again in mid-air to double jump for extra height.
Once you have all of the sled pieces, press and hold the left mouse button to sled!
